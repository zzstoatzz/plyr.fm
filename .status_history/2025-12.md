# plyr.fm Status History - December 2025

## December 2025 Work (Dec 1-7)

### playlist release fast-follow fixes (PRs #507-510, Dec 7)

**what shipped** (all merged to main):
- **PR #507**: include `image_url` in playlist SSR data for og:image link previews
- **PR #508**: invalidate layout data after token exchange - fixes stale auth state after login
- **PR #509**: playlist menus and link previews - fixed stopPropagation blocking links, added `/playlist/` to hasPageMetadata
- **PR #510**: inline playlist creation - replaced navigation-based create with inline form to avoid playback interruption

**the navigation bug** (PR #510):
- clicking "create new playlist" from AddToMenu/TrackActionsMenu previously navigated to `/library?create=playlist`
- this caused SvelteKit to reinitialize the layout, destroying the audio element and stopping playback
- fix: added inline create form that creates playlist and adds track in one action without navigation
- same pattern applied to TrackActionsMenu (mobile bottom sheet menu)

---

### playlists, ATProto sync, and library hub (feat/playlists branch, PR #499, Dec 6-7)

**status**: shipped and deployed.

**playlists** (full CRUD):
- `playlists` and `playlist_tracks` tables with Alembic migration
- `POST /lists/playlists` - create playlist
- `PUT /lists/playlists/{id}` - rename playlist
- `DELETE /lists/playlists/{id}` - delete playlist
- `POST /lists/playlists/{id}/tracks` - add track to playlist
- `DELETE /lists/playlists/{id}/tracks/{track_id}` - remove track
- `PUT /lists/playlists/{id}/tracks/reorder` - reorder tracks
- `POST /lists/playlists/{id}/cover` - upload cover art
- playlist detail page (`/playlist/[id]`) with edit modal, drag-and-drop reordering
- playlists in global search results
- "add to playlist" menu on tracks (filters out current playlist when on playlist page)
- inline "create new playlist" in add-to menu (creates playlist and adds track in one action)
- playlist sharing with OpenGraph link previews

**ATProto integration**:
- `fm.plyr.list` lexicon for syncing playlists and albums to user PDSes
- `fm.plyr.actor.profile` lexicon for syncing artist profiles
- automatic sync of albums, liked tracks, and profile on login (fire-and-forget)
- scope upgrade OAuth flow for teal.fm integration (#503)

**library hub** (`/library`):
- unified page with tabs: liked, playlists, albums
- create playlist modal with inline form
- consistent card layouts across sections
- nav changed from "liked" → "library"

**user experience**:
- public liked pages for any user (`/liked/[handle]`)
- `show_liked_on_profile` preference
- portal album/playlist section visual consistency
- toast notifications for all mutations (playlist CRUD, profile updates)
- z-index fixes for dropdown menus

**accessibility fixes**:
- fixed 32 svelte-check warnings (ARIA roles, button nesting, unused CSS)
- proper roles on modals, menus, and drag-drop elements

**design decisions**:
- lists are generic ordered collections of any ATProto records
- `listType` semantically categorizes (album, playlist, liked) but doesn't restrict content
- array order = display order, reorder via `putRecord`
- strongRef (uri + cid) for content-addressable item references
- "library" = umbrella term for personal collections

**sync architecture**:
- **profile, albums, liked tracks**: synced on login via `GET /artists/me` (fire-and-forget background tasks)
- **playlists**: synced on create/modify (not at login) - avoids N playlist syncs on every login
- sync tasks don't block the response (~300-500ms for the endpoint, PDS calls happen in background)
- putRecord calls take ~50-100ms each, with automatic DPoP nonce retry on 401

**file size audit** (candidates for future modularization):
- `portal/+page.svelte`: 2,436 lines (58% CSS)
- `playlist/[id]/+page.svelte`: 1,644 lines (48% CSS)
- `api/lists.py`: 855 lines
- CSS-heavy files could benefit from shared style extraction in future

**related issues**: #221, #146, #498

### list reordering UI (feat/playlists branch, Dec 7)

**what's done**:
- `PUT /lists/liked/reorder` endpoint - reorder user's liked tracks list
- `PUT /lists/{rkey}/reorder` endpoint - reorder any list by ATProto rkey
- both endpoints take `items` array of strongRefs (uri + cid) in desired order
- liked tracks page (`/liked`) now has "reorder" button for authenticated users
- album page has "reorder" button for album owner (if album has ATProto list record)
- drag-and-drop reordering on desktop (HTML5 drag API)
- touch reordering on mobile (6-dot grip handle, same pattern as queue)
- visual feedback during drag: `.drag-over` and `.is-dragging` states
- saves order to ATProto via `putRecord` when user clicks "done"
- added `atproto_record_cid` to TrackResponse schema (needed for strongRefs)
- added `artist_did` and `list_uri` to AlbumMetadata response

**UX design**:
- button toggles between "reorder" and "done" states
- in edit mode, drag handles appear next to each track
- saving shows spinner, success/error toast on completion
- only owners can see/use reorder button (liked list = current user, album = artist)

---

### scope upgrade OAuth flow (feat/scope-invalidation branch, Dec 7) - merged to feat/playlists

**problem**: when users enabled teal.fm scrobbling, the app showed a passive "please log out and back in" message because the session lacked the required OAuth scopes. this was confusing UX.

**solution**: immediate OAuth handshake when enabling features that require new scopes (same pattern as developer tokens).

**what's done**:
- `POST /auth/scope-upgrade/start` endpoint initiates OAuth with expanded scopes
- `pending_scope_upgrades` table tracks in-flight upgrades (10min TTL)
- callback replaces old session with new one, redirects to `/settings?scope_upgraded=true`
- frontend shows spinner during redirect, success toast on return
- fixed preferences bug where toggling settings reset theme to dark mode

**code quality**:
- eliminated bifurcated OAuth clients (`oauth_client` vs `oauth_client_with_teal`)
- replaced with `get_oauth_client(include_teal=False)` factory function
- at ~17 OAuth flows/day, instantiation cost is negligible
- explicit scope selection at call site instead of module-level state

**developer token UX**:
- full-page overlay when returning from OAuth after creating a developer token
- token displayed prominently with warning that it won't be shown again
- copy button with success feedback, link to python SDK docs
- prevents users from missing their token (was buried at bottom of page)

**test fixes**:
- fixed connection pool exhaustion in tests (was hitting Neon's connection limit)
- added `DATABASE_POOL_SIZE=2`, `DATABASE_MAX_OVERFLOW=0` to pytest env vars
- dispose cached engines after each test to prevent connection accumulation
- fixed mock function signatures for `refresh_session` tests

**tests**: 4 new tests for scope upgrade flow, all 281 tests passing

---

### settings consolidation (PR #496, Dec 6)

**problem**: user preferences were scattered across multiple locations with confusing terminology:
- SensitiveImage tooltip said "enable in portal" but mobile menu said "profile"
- clicking gear icon (SettingsMenu) only showed appearance/playback, not all settings
- portal mixed content management with preferences

**solution**: clear separation between **settings** (preferences) and **portal** (content & data):

| page | purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/settings` | preferences: theme, accent color, auto-advance, sensitive artwork, timed comments, teal.fm, developer tokens |
| `/portal` | your content & data: profile, tracks, albums, export, delete account |

**changes**:
- created dedicated `/settings` route consolidating all user preferences
- slimmed portal to focus on content management
- added "all settings →" link to SettingsMenu and ProfileMenu
- renamed mobile menu "profile" → "portal" to match route
- moved delete account to portal's "your data" section (it's about data, not preferences)
- fixed `font-family: inherit` on all settings page buttons
- updated SensitiveImage tooltip: "enable in settings"

### bufo easter egg improvements (PRs #491-492, Dec 6)

**what shipped**:
- configurable exclude/include patterns via env vars for bufo easter egg
- `BUFO_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS`: regex patterns to filter out (default: `^bigbufo_`)
- `BUFO_INCLUDE_PATTERNS`: allowlist that overrides exclude (default: `bigbufo_0_0`, `bigbufo_2_1`)
- cache key now includes patterns so config changes take effect immediately

**reusable type**:
- added `CommaSeparatedStringSet` type for parsing comma-delimited env vars into sets
- uses pydantic `BeforeValidator` with `Annotated` pattern (not class-coupled validators)
- handles: `VAR=a,b,c` → `{"a", "b", "c"}`

**context**: bigbufo tiles are 4x4 grid fragments that looked weird floating individually. now excluded by default, with two specific tiles allowed through.

**thread**: https://bsky.app/profile/zzstoatzzdevlog.bsky.social/post/3m7e3ndmgwl2m

---

### mobile artwork upload fix (PR #489, Dec 6)

**problem**: artwork uploads from iOS Photos library silently failed - track uploaded successfully but without artwork.

**root cause**: iOS stores photos in HEIC format. when selected, iOS converts content to JPEG but often keeps the `.heic` filename. backend validated format using only filename extension → rejected as "unsupported format".

**fix**:
- backend now prefers MIME content_type over filename extension for format detection
- added `ImageFormat.from_content_type()` method
- frontend uses `accept="image/*"` for broader iOS compatibility

---

### sensitive image moderation (PRs #471-488, Dec 5-6)

**what shipped**:
- `sensitive_images` table to flag problematic images by R2 `image_id` or external URL
- `show_sensitive_artwork` user preference (default: hidden, toggle in portal → "your data")
- flagged images blurred everywhere: track lists, player, artist pages, likers tooltip, search results, embeds
- Media Session API (CarPlay, lock screen, control center) respects sensitive preference
- SSR-safe filtering: link previews (og:image) exclude sensitive images on track, artist, and album pages
- likers tooltip UX: max-height with scroll, hover interaction fix, viewport-aware flip positioning
- likers tooltip z-index: elevates entire track-container when tooltip open (prevents sibling tracks bleeding through)

**how it works**:
- frontend fetches `/moderation/sensitive-images` and stores flagged IDs/URLs
- `SensitiveImage` component wraps images and checks against flagged list
- server-side check via `+layout.server.ts` for meta tag filtering
- users can opt-in to view sensitive artwork via portal toggle

**coverage** (PR #488):

| context | approach |
|---------|----------|
| DOM images needing blur | `SensitiveImage` component |
| small avatars in lists | `SensitiveImage` with `compact` prop |
| SSR meta tags (og:image) | `checkImageSensitive()` function |
| non-DOM APIs (media session) | direct `isSensitive()` + `showSensitiveArtwork` check |

**moderation workflow**:
- admin adds row to `sensitive_images` with `image_id` (R2) or `url` (external)
- images are blurred immediately for all users
- users who enable `show_sensitive_artwork` see unblurred images

### teal.fm scrobbling integration (PR #467, Dec 4)

**what shipped**:
- native teal.fm scrobbling: when users enable the toggle, plays are recorded to their PDS using teal's ATProto lexicons
- scrobble triggers at 30% or 30 seconds (whichever comes first) - same threshold as play counts
- user preference stored in database, toggleable from portal → "your data"
- settings link to pdsls.dev so users can view their scrobble records

**lexicons used**:
- `fm.teal.alpha.feed.play` - individual play records (scrobbles)
- `fm.teal.alpha.actor.status` - now-playing status updates

**configuration** (all optional, sensible defaults):
- `TEAL_ENABLED` (default: `true`) - feature flag for entire integration
- `TEAL_PLAY_COLLECTION` (default: `fm.teal.alpha.feed.play`)
- `TEAL_STATUS_COLLECTION` (default: `fm.teal.alpha.actor.status`)

**code quality improvements** (same PR):
- added `settings.frontend.domain` computed property for environment-aware URLs
- extracted `get_session_id_from_request()` utility for bearer token parsing
- added field validator on `DeveloperTokenInfo.session_id` for auto-truncation
- applied walrus operators throughout auth and playback code
- fixed now-playing endpoint firing every 1 second (fingerprint update bug in scheduled reports)

**documentation**: `backend/src/backend/_internal/atproto/teal.py` contains inline docs on the scrobbling flow

---

### unified search (PR #447, Dec 3)

**what shipped**:
- `Cmd+K` (mac) / `Ctrl+K` (windows/linux) opens search modal from anywhere
- fuzzy matching across tracks, artists, albums, and tags using PostgreSQL `pg_trgm`
- results grouped by type with relevance scores (0.0-1.0)
- keyboard navigation (arrow keys, enter, esc)
- artwork/avatars displayed with lazy loading and fallback icons
- glassmorphism modal styling with backdrop blur
- debounced input (150ms) with client-side validation

**database**:
- enabled `pg_trgm` extension for trigram-based similarity search
- GIN indexes on `tracks.title`, `artists.handle`, `artists.display_name`, `albums.title`, `tags.name`

**documentation**: `docs/frontend/search.md`, `docs/frontend/keyboard-shortcuts.md`

**follow-up polish** (PRs #449-463):
- mobile search icon in header (PRs #455-456)
- theme-aware modal styling with styled scrollbar (#450)
- ILIKE fallback for substring matches when trigram fails (#452)
- tag collapse with +N button (#453)
- input focus fix: removed `visibility: hidden` so focus works on open (#457, #463)
- album artwork fallback in player when track has no image (#458)
- rate limiting exemption for now-playing endpoints (#460)
- `--no-dev` flag for release command to prevent dev dep installation (#461)

### light/dark theme and mobile UX overhaul (Dec 2-3)

**theme system** (PR #441):
- replaced hardcoded colors across 35 files with CSS custom properties
- semantic tokens: `--bg-primary`, `--text-secondary`, `--accent`, etc.
- theme switcher in settings: dark / light / system (follows OS preference)
- removed zen mode feature (superseded by proper theme support)

**mobile UX improvements** (PR #443):
- new `ProfileMenu` component — collapses profile, upload, settings, logout into touch-optimized menu (44px tap targets)
- dedicated `/upload` page — extracted from portal for cleaner mobile flow
- portal overhaul — tighter forms, track detail links under artwork, fixed icon alignment
- standardized section headers across home and liked tracks pages

**player scroll timing fix** (PR #445):
- reduced title scroll cycle from 10s → 8s, artist/album from 15s → 10s
- eliminated 1.5s invisible pause at end of scroll animation
- fixed duplicate upload toast (was firing twice on success)
- upload success toast now includes "view track" link

**CI optimization** (PR #444):
- pre-commit hooks now skip based on changed paths
- result: ~10s for most PRs instead of ~1m20s
- only installs tooling (uv, bun) needed for changed directories

---

### tag filtering system and SDK tag support (Dec 2)

**tag filtering** (PRs #431-434):
- users can now hide tracks by tag via eye icon filter in discovery feed
- preferences centralized in root layout (fetched once, shared across app)
- `HiddenTagsFilter` component with expandable UI for managing hidden tags
- default hidden tags: `["ai"]` for new users
- tag detail pages at `/tag/[name]` with all tracks for that tag
- clickable tag badges on tracks navigate to tag pages

**navigation fix** (PR #435):
- fixed tag links interrupting audio playback
- root cause: `stopPropagation()` on links breaks SvelteKit's client-side router
- documented pattern in `docs/frontend/navigation.md` to prevent recurrence

**SDK tag support** (plyr-python-client v0.0.1-alpha.10):
- added `tags: set[str]` parameter to `upload()` in SDK
- added `-t/--tag` CLI option (can be used multiple times)
- updated MCP `upload_guide` prompt with tag examples
- status maintenance workflow now tags AI-generated podcasts with `ai` (#436)

**tags in detail pages** (PR #437):
- track detail endpoint (`/tracks/{id}`) now returns tags
- album detail endpoint (`/albums/{handle}/{slug}`) now returns tags for all tracks
- track detail page displays clickable tag badges

**bufo easter egg** (PR #438, improved in #491-492):
- tracks tagged with `bufo` trigger animated toad GIFs on the detail page
- uses track title as semantic search query against [find-bufo API](https://find-bufo.fly.dev/)
- toads are semantically matched to the song's vibe (e.g., "Happy Vibes" gets happy toads)
- results cached in localStorage (1 week TTL) to minimize API calls
- `TagEffects` wrapper component provides extensibility for future tag-based plugins
- respects `prefers-reduced-motion`; fails gracefully if API unavailable
- configurable exclude/include patterns via env vars (see Dec 6 entry above)

---

### queue touch reordering and header stats fix (Dec 2)

**queue mobile UX** (PR #428):
- added 6-dot drag handle to queue items for touch-friendly reordering
- implemented touch event handlers for mobile drag-and-drop
- track follows finger during drag with smooth translateY transform
- drop target highlights while dragging over other tracks

**header stats positioning** (PR #426):
- fixed platform stats not adjusting when queue sidebar opens/closes
- added `--queue-width` CSS custom property updated dynamically
- stats now shift left with smooth transition when queue opens

---

### connection pool resilience for Neon cold starts (Dec 2)

**incident**: ~5 minute API outage (01:55-02:00 UTC) - all requests returned 500 errors

**root cause**: Neon serverless cold start after 5 minutes of idle traffic
- queue listener heartbeat detected dead connection, began reconnection
- first 5 user requests each held a connection waiting for Neon to wake up (3-5 min each)
- with pool_size=5 and max_overflow=0, pool exhausted immediately
- all subsequent requests got `QueuePool limit of size 5 overflow 0 reached`

**fix**:
- increased `pool_size` from 5 → 10 (handle more concurrent cold start requests)
- increased `max_overflow` from 0 → 5 (allow burst to 15 connections)
- increased `connection_timeout` from 3s → 10s (wait for Neon wake-up)

**related**: this is a recurrence of the Nov 17 incident. that fix addressed the queue listener's asyncpg connection but not the SQLAlchemy pool connections.

---

### now-playing API (PR #416, Dec 1)

**what shipped**:
- `GET /now-playing/{did}` and `GET /now-playing/by-handle/{handle}` endpoints
- returns track metadata, playback position, timestamp
- 204 when nothing playing, 200 with track data otherwise

**teal.fm integration**:
- native scrobbling shipped in PR #467 (Dec 4) - plyr.fm writes directly to user's PDS
- Piper integration (external polling) still open: https://github.com/teal-fm/piper/pull/27

---

### admin UI improvements for moderation (PRs #408-414, Dec 1)

**what shipped**:
- dropdown menu for false positive reasons (fingerprint noise, original artist, fair use, other)
- artist/track links open in new tabs for verification
- AuDD score normalization (scores shown as 0-100 range)
- filter controls to show only high-confidence matches
- form submission fixes for htmx POST requests

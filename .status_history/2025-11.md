## copyright moderation system (PRs #382, #384, Nov 29-30)

**motivation**: detect potential copyright violations in uploaded tracks to avoid DMCA issues and protect the platform.

**what shipped**:
- **moderation service** (Rust/Axum on Fly.io):
  - standalone service at `plyr-moderation.fly.dev`
  - integrates with AuDD enterprise API for audio fingerprinting
  - scans audio URLs and returns matches with metadata (artist, title, album, ISRC, timecode)
  - auth via `X-Moderation-Key` header
- **backend integration** (PR #382):
  - `ModerationSettings` in config (service URL, auth token, timeout)
  - moderation client module (`backend/_internal/moderation.py`)
  - fire-and-forget background task on track upload
  - stores results in `copyright_scans` table
  - scan errors stored as "clear" so tracks aren't stuck unscanned
- **flagging fix** (PR #384):
  - AuDD enterprise API returns no confidence scores (all 0)
  - changed from score threshold to presence-based flagging: `is_flagged = !matches.is_empty()`
  - removed unused `score_threshold` config
- **backfill script** (`scripts/scan_tracks_copyright.py`):
  - scans existing tracks that haven't been checked
  - `--max-duration` flag to skip long DJ sets (estimated from file size)
  - `--dry-run` mode to preview what would be scanned
  - supports dev/staging/prod environments
- **review workflow**:
  - `copyright_scans` table has `resolution`, `reviewed_at`, `reviewed_by`, `review_notes` columns
  - resolution values: `violation`, `false_positive`, `original_artist`

**initial review results** (25 flagged tracks):
- 8 violations (actual copyright issues)
- 11 false positives (fingerprint noise)
- 6 original artists (people uploading their own distributed music)

## developer tokens with independent OAuth grants (PR #367, Nov 28)

**motivation**: programmatic API access (scripts, CLIs, automation) needed tokens that survive browser logout and don't become stale when browser sessions refresh.

**what shipped**:
- **OAuth-based dev tokens**: each developer token gets its own OAuth authorization flow
  - user clicks "create token" → redirected to PDS for authorization → token created with independent credentials
  - tokens have their own DPoP keypair, access/refresh tokens - completely separate from browser session
- **cookie isolation**: dev token exchange doesn't set browser cookie
  - added `is_dev_token` flag to ExchangeToken model
  - /auth/exchange skips Set-Cookie for dev token flows
  - prevents logout from deleting dev tokens (critical bug fixed during implementation)
- **token management UI**: portal → "your data" → "developer tokens"
  - create with optional name and expiration (30/90/180/365 days or never)
  - list active tokens with creation/expiration dates
  - revoke individual tokens
- **API endpoints**:
  - `POST /auth/developer-token/start` - initiates OAuth flow, returns auth_url
  - `GET /auth/developer-tokens` - list user's tokens
  - `DELETE /auth/developer-tokens/{prefix}` - revoke by 8-char prefix

**security properties**:
- tokens are full sessions with encrypted OAuth credentials (Fernet)
- each token refreshes independently (no staleness from browser session refresh)
- revokable individually without affecting browser or other tokens
- explicit OAuth consent required at PDS for each token created

**documentation**: see `docs/authentication.md` "developer tokens" section

## platform stats and media session integration (PRs #359-379, Nov 27-29)

**motivation**: show platform activity at a glance, improve playback experience across devices, and give users control over their data.

**what shipped**:
- **platform stats endpoint and UI** (PRs #376, #378, #379):
  - `GET /stats` returns total plays, tracks, and artists
  - stats bar displays in homepage header (e.g., "1,691 plays • 55 tracks • 8 artists")
  - skeleton loading animation while fetching
  - responsive layout: visible in header on wide screens, collapses to menu on narrow
  - end-of-list animation on homepage
- **Media Session API** (PR #371):
  - provides track metadata to CarPlay, lock screens, Bluetooth devices, macOS control center
  - artwork display with fallback to artist avatar
  - play/pause, prev/next, seek controls all work from system UI
  - position state syncs scrubbers on external interfaces
- **browser tab title** (PR #374):
  - shows "track - artist • plyr.fm" while playing
  - persists across page navigation
  - reverts to page title when playback stops
- **timed comments** (PR #359):
  - comments capture timestamp when added during playback
  - clickable timestamp buttons seek to that moment
  - compact scrollable comments section on track pages
- **constellation integration** (PR #360):
  - queries constellation.microcosm.blue backlink index
  - enables network-wide like counts (not just plyr.fm internal)
  - environment-aware namespace handling
- **account deletion** (PR #363):
  - explicit confirmation flow (type handle to confirm)
  - deletes all plyr.fm data (tracks, albums, likes, comments, preferences)
  - optional ATProto record cleanup with clear warnings about orphaned references

## oEmbed endpoint for Leaflet.pub embeds (PRs #355-358, Nov 25)

**motivation**: plyr.fm tracks embedded in Leaflet.pub (via iframely) showed a black HTML5 audio box instead of our custom embed player.

**what shipped**:
- **oEmbed endpoint** (PR #355): `/oembed` returns proper embed HTML with iframe
  - follows oEmbed spec with `type: "rich"` and iframe in `html` field
  - discovery link in track page `<head>` for automatic detection
- **iframely domain registration**: registered plyr.fm on iframely.com (free tier)
  - this was the key fix - iframely now returns our embed iframe as `links.player[0]`

**debugging journey** (PRs #356-358):
- initially tried `og:video` meta tags to hint iframe embed - didn't work
- tried removing `og:audio` to force oEmbed fallback - resulted in no player link
- discovered iframely requires domain registration to trust oEmbed providers
- after registration, iframely correctly returns embed iframe URL

## export & upload reliability (PRs #337-344, Nov 24)

**motivation**: exports were failing silently on large files (OOM), uploads showed incorrect progress, and SSE connections triggered false error toasts.

**what shipped**:
- **database-backed jobs** (PR #337): moved upload/export tracking from in-memory to postgres
  - jobs table persists state across server restarts
  - enables reliable progress tracking via SSE polling
- **streaming exports** (PR #343): fixed OOM on large file exports
  - previously loaded entire files into memory via `response["Body"].read()`
  - now streams to temp files, adds to zip from disk (constant memory)
  - 90-minute WAV files now export successfully on 1GB VM
- **progress tracking fix** (PR #340): upload progress was receiving bytes but treating as percentage
  - `UploadProgressTracker` now properly converts bytes to percentage
  - upload progress bar works correctly again
- **UX improvements** (PRs #338-339, #341-342, #344):
  - export filename now includes date (`plyr-tracks-2025-11-24.zip`)
  - toast notification on track deletion
  - fixed false "lost connection" error when SSE completes normally
  - progress now shows "downloading track X of Y" instead of confusing count

## queue hydration + ATProto token hardening (Nov 12)

**why**: queue endpoints were occasionally taking 2s+ and restore operations could 401
when multiple requests refreshed an expired ATProto token simultaneously.

**what shipped**:
- added persistent `image_url` on `Track` rows so queue hydration no longer probes R2
  for every track. Queue payloads now pull art directly from Postgres, with a one-time
  fallback for legacy rows.
- updated `_internal/queue.py` to backfill any missing URLs once (with caching) instead
  of per-request GETs.
- introduced per-session locks in `_refresh_session_tokens` so only one coroutine hits
  `oauth_client.refresh_session` at a time; others reuse the refreshed tokens. This
  removes the race that caused the batch restore flow to intermittently 500/401.

**impact**: queue tail latency dropped back under 500 ms in staging tests, ATProto restore flows are now reliable under concurrent use, and Logfire no longer shows 500s from the PDS.

## performance optimization session (Nov 12)

**issue: slow /tracks/liked endpoint**

**symptoms**:
- `/tracks/liked` taking 600-900ms consistently
- only ~25ms spent in database queries
- mysterious 575ms gap with no spans in Logfire traces

**root cause**:
- PR #184 added `image_url` column to tracks table to eliminate N+1 R2 API calls
- legacy tracks (15 tracks uploaded before PR) had `image_url = NULL`
- fallback code called `track.get_image_url()` which makes uninstrumented R2 `head_object` API calls
- 5 tracks × 120ms = ~600ms of uninstrumented latency

**solution**: created `scripts/backfill_image_urls.py` to populate missing `image_url` values

**results**:
- `/tracks/liked` now sub-200ms (down from 600-900ms)
- all endpoints now consistently sub-second response times

**database cleanup**:
- discovered `queue_state` had 265% bloat (53 dead rows, 20 live rows)
- ran `VACUUM (FULL, ANALYZE) queue_state` against production

---

## track detail pages (PR #164, Nov 12)

- ✅ dedicated track detail pages with large cover art
- ✅ play button updates queue state correctly (#169)
- ✅ liked state loaded efficiently via server-side fetch
- ✅ mobile-optimized layouts with proper scrolling constraints
- ✅ origin validation for image URLs (#168)

---

## liked tracks feature (PR #157, Nov 11)

- ✅ server-side persistent collections
- ✅ ATProto record publication for cross-platform visibility
- ✅ UI for adding/removing tracks from liked collection
- ✅ like counts displayed in track responses and analytics (#170)
- ✅ analytics cards now clickable links to track detail pages (#171)
- ✅ liked state shown on artist page tracks (#163)

**status**: COMPLETE (issue #144 closed)

---

## upload streaming + progress UX (PR #182, Nov 11)

- Frontend switched from `fetch` to `XMLHttpRequest` so we can display upload progress
  toasts (critical for >50 MB mixes on mobile).
- Upload form now clears only after the request succeeds; failed attempts leave the
  form intact so users don't lose metadata.
- Backend writes uploads/images to temp files in 8 MB chunks before handing them to the
  storage layer, eliminating whole-file buffering and iOS crashes for hour-long mixes.
- Deployment verified locally and by rerunning the exact repro Stella hit (85 minute
  mix from mobile).

---

## transcoder API deployment (PR #156, Nov 11)

**standalone Rust transcoding service**
- **deployed**: https://plyr-transcoder.fly.dev/
- **purpose**: convert AIFF/FLAC/etc. to MP3 for browser compatibility
- **technology**: Axum + ffmpeg + Docker
- **security**: `X-Transcoder-Key` header authentication (shared secret)
- **capacity**: handles 1GB uploads, tested with 85-minute AIFF files (~858MB → 195MB MP3 in 32 seconds)
- **architecture**:
  - 2 Fly machines for high availability
  - auto-stop/start for cost efficiency
  - stateless design (no R2 integration yet)
  - 320kbps MP3 output with proper ID3 tags
- **status**: deployed and tested, ready for integration into plyr.fm upload pipeline
- **next steps**: wire into backend with R2 integration and job queue (see issue #153)

---

## AIFF/AIF browser compatibility fix (PR #152, Nov 11)

**format validation improvements**
- **problem discovered**: AIFF/AIF files only work in Safari, not Chrome/Firefox
  - browsers throw `MediaError code 4: MEDIA_ERR_SRC_NOT_SUPPORTED`
  - users could upload files but they wouldn't play in most browsers
- **immediate solution**: reject AIFF/AIF uploads at both backend and frontend
  - removed AIFF/AIF from AudioFormat enum
  - added format hints to upload UI: "supported: mp3, wav, m4a"
  - client-side validation with helpful error messages
- **long-term solution**: deployed standalone transcoder service (see above)
  - separate Rust/Axum service with ffmpeg
  - accepts all formats, converts to browser-compatible MP3
  - integration into upload pipeline pending (issue #153)

**observability improvements**:
- added logfire instrumentation to upload background tasks
- added logfire spans to R2 storage operations
- documented logfire querying patterns in `docs/logfire-querying.md`

## async I/O performance fixes (PRs #149-151, Nov 10-11)

Eliminated event loop blocking across backend with three critical PRs:

1. **PR #149: async R2 reads** - converted R2 `head_object` operations from sync boto3 to async aioboto3
   - portal page load time: 2+ seconds → ~200ms
   - root cause: `track.image_url` was blocking on serial R2 HEAD requests

2. **PR #150: concurrent PDS resolution** - parallelized ATProto PDS URL lookups
   - homepage load time: 2-6 seconds → 200-400ms
   - root cause: serial `resolve_atproto_data()` calls (8 artists × 200-300ms each)
   - fix: `asyncio.gather()` for batch resolution, database caching for subsequent loads

3. **PR #151: async storage writes/deletes** - made save/delete operations non-blocking
   - R2: switched to `aioboto3` for uploads/deletes (async S3 operations)
   - filesystem: used `anyio.Path` and `anyio.open_file()` for chunked async I/O (64KB chunks)
   - impact: multi-MB uploads no longer monopolize worker thread, constant memory usage

- ✅ bluesky attribution link in header
- ✅ changelog target added (#183)
- ✅ documentation updates (#158)
- ✅ track metadata edits now persist correctly (#162)

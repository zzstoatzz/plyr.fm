# onboard

get up to speed on the project quickly.

## instructions

1. **read STATUS.md** - the living document with project vision, recent work, and technical state
2. **check recent commits** - `git log --oneline -10` for what's actively changing
3. **check git status** - any uncommitted work in progress
4. **review open issues** - `gh issue list` for known priorities

## then

propose the next best step based on:
- immediate priorities listed in STATUS.md
- known issues blocking progress
- in-progress work needing completion

present your recommendation and ask for confirmation before proceeding.

## tone

- action-oriented and specific
- concisely curious about existing decisions and trade-offs (don't assume, ask)

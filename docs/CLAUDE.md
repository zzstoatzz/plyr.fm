# docs

living repository of design decisions, learned lessons, and implementation details.

- document **how** things work and **why** decisions were made
- as much detail as possible - this is the knowledge base
- keep up to date as you work (will be automated via cron eventually)
- when you solve a problem or make a design choice, document it here

# privacy policy

**last updated:** december 16, 2025

this policy explains what data we collect, what's public by design on the AT Protocol, and your rights.

## 1. the AT Protocol

plyr.fm uses the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com) for identity and social features. this has important implications:

**public by design:** your DID, handle, profile, tracks, likes, and comments are stored on the decentralized AT Protocol network. this data is visible to anyone on the network, not just plyr.fm users.

**external PDS:** if your account is hosted on Bluesky's PDS or another provider (not ours), we do not control that data. their privacy policies govern it.

**private data:** session tokens, preferences, and server logs are stored only on our servers.

## 2. data we collect

**you provide:** your ATProto identity when you log in, audio files and metadata you upload, and preferences like accent color.

**automatically:** play counts, IP addresses, browser info, and session cookies for authentication.

## 3. how we use it

we use your data to provide the service, maintain your session, and improve the platform. we do not sell your data or use it for advertising.

## 4. third parties

we use:

- **Cloudflare** - CDN, storage (R2)
- **Fly.io** - backend hosting
- **Neon** - database
- **Logfire** - error monitoring
- **AT Protocol network** - public data federation

## 5. your rights

you can access, correct, or delete your data through settings. when you delete your account, we remove your files from our storage and your data from our database.

**we cannot delete:** your DID (you control it), data on other ATProto servers, or records in other users' PDSes.

## 6. security

we use HTTPS, encrypt sensitive data, and use HttpOnly cookies. no system is perfectly secure—report vulnerabilities to contact@plyr.fm.

## 7. children

plyr.fm is not for children under 13. we do not knowingly collect data from children.

## 8. changes

we may update this policy. material changes will be posted with notice.

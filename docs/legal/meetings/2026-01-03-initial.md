# lawyer meeting agenda

## context

- plyr.fm: music streaming on AT Protocol (decentralized)
- 38 uploaders, 497 tracks, ~3600 plays (hobby scale)
- pre-revenue, losing money
- users upload audio, no enforcement it's their own
- DMCA agent registered (DMCA-1069186)

## ask 1: terms & privacy review

- are these adequate for a pre-revenue project?
- anything missing that creates imminent risk?
- federation caveat sufficient? ("we can only remove from our servers, not other AT Protocol servers")

## ask 2: LLC formation

**state:** Delaware vs Illinois vs Wyoming - tradeoffs for solo, pre-revenue?

**formation:** lawyer vs online service vs self-file? cost? timeline?

**ongoing:** operating agreement needed? annual reports? what maintains/pierces liability shield?

**existing stuff:** DMCA registration is personal - transfer to LLC? need separate bank account?

## ask 3: copyright scanning

we run AudD fingerprinting on uploads and publish results as public labels, but don't auto-remove - many results need manual review, confidence varies.

does having public evidence of potential matches we haven't acted on create "red flag knowledge" risk? or is it reasonable given the noise in the data?

## ask 4: image moderation / NCMEC

we scan uploaded images via Claude (NSFW, CSAM, hate symbols, violence). flagged images are blurred, not removed.

REPORT Act (2024) requires reporting CSAM to NCMEC when provider "becomes aware" - since we're scanning, a flag would trigger this. do we need to set up CyberTipline reporting, or is this overkill at hobby scale?

## ask 5: future triggers

when do I need to worry about music licensing, formal moderation policies, different liability posture - scale, revenue, or both?

## not asking today

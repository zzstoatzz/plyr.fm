# meeting notes - 2026-01-02

## action items

1. ✅ **send docs to lawyer** - sent PDF versions of terms, privacy policy, meeting agenda

2. **LLC formation** (lawyer handling)
   - lawyer sending survey to collect info needed for filing
   - he'll handle Secretary of State paperwork
   - waiting on his end

3. **stop posting public copyright labels** (me)
   - lawyer says posting "potential violation" labels without acting on them doesn't help anyone
   - safe harbor requires action when you have knowledge - public labels = knowledge
   - need to redesign moderation pipeline:
     - higher confidence threshold before flagging
     - when flagged → automated user notification (DM or similar)
     - then takedown
   - **this is the main outstanding work**

## key takeaway

public labels saying "maybe copyright violation" without follow-through = liability risk. either don't flag it, or flag it and act on it.

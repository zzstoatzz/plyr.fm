# terms of service

**last updated:** december 16, 2025

these terms govern your use of plyr.fm, a music streaming platform built on the AT Protocol. by using the service, you agree to these terms.

## 1. acceptance of terms

by accessing or using plyr.fm, you agree to be bound by these terms. if you disagree with any part, you may not use the service.

## 2. accounts

plyr.fm uses AT Protocol for authentication. your identity is your DID (decentralized identifier), not an account we control. we do not store passwords.

we may terminate or suspend your access at any time, for any reason. termination removes your content from plyr.fm but does not affect your DID or data on your PDS—we don't control those.

## 3. content

you retain ownership of content you upload. by uploading, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute your content as necessary to provide the service.

you represent that you own or have the necessary rights to the content you upload, and that it does not infringe any third party's rights.

## 4. acceptable use

you agree not to:

- violate any applicable laws
- infringe on others' rights
- upload content that is illegal or infringes copyright
- attempt unauthorized access to the service
- interfere with or disrupt the service

## 5. copyright & DMCA

we respond to valid DMCA takedown notices. our designated agent is:

> Nathan Nowack
> DMCA Registration: DMCA-1069186
> Email: dmca@plyr.fm

we terminate accounts of repeat infringers.

**AT Protocol limitation:** we can only remove content from our servers. we cannot delete content that has been published to other AT Protocol servers or your PDS.

## 6. disclaimers

the service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind. we do not guarantee uptime or that the service will be error-free.

we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages resulting from your use of the service.

## 7. changes

we may update these terms. material changes will be posted with notice. continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
